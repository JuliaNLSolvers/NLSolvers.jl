# TODO add double dog leg and subspace dogleg
#===============================================================================
  Dogleg is a trust region sub-problem solver used to generate a cheap and crude
  approximation to the solution. If the Cauchy step is outside of the trust re-
  gion it will scale it down to have the length of the radius. If Cauchy step
  is in the interior, it will find the intersection between the Newton step and
  the Cauchy step. Since the trust region is a Euclidean Ball, it is simple to
  find this point on the trust region boundary.

  The Dogleg solver is only appropriate for positive definite Hessians.
